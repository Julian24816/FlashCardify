Front,Back
What is the goal of reinforcement learning algorithms?,To minimize parameter error and maximize received reinforcement over time.
What are two strategies that both Q-learning and the Bucket Brigade use?,They are both gradient descent strategies that perform temporal and structural credit assignment.
What do classifier systems couple in their learning process?,They couple reinforcement learning and genetic learning.
"In a classifier system, what role does reinforcement learning play?",It orders the classifiers by strength.
What happens to the weakest classifiers in a classifier system?,They are discarded.
What is the initial condition for classifiers in a system when the genetic portion is removed?,All classifiers must be supplied initially.
"What does each classifier C(s,a) represent?","C(s,a) represents the condition or the n-bit input state 's' and the action 'a'."
How do Q-learning and the Bucket Brigade handle reward propagation?,"Q-learning uses the maximum discounted future reward, while the Bucket Brigade computes the current reward and propagates it to the previous state."
What is the measure of specificity for classifiers in the system?,"P, the measure of specificity, is the same for all classifiers, and the P term is dropped from the bid equation."
